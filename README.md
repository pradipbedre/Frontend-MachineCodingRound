# About Frontend-Machine-Coding-Round
A frontend matching coding round is a technical assessment typically used by companies to evaluate the programming skills of candidates applying for frontend developer roles.

The goal of this type of coding round is to assess the candidate's ability to solve coding problems and build web applications using front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as frontend frameworks such as React, Angular, or Vue.

A typical frontend matching coding round may involve a series of coding challenges or tasks that the candidate must complete within a given time limit(depends on task). 

These tasks may include building a simple web application, implementing a particular feature, or solving a programming problem using front-end technologies. 

The challenges are designed to test the candidate's knowledge of the relevant technologies, as well as their ability to solve problems and write clean, efficient code.
